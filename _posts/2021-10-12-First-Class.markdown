Muscle Snatch - Do not re-dip, explode up and keep the bar close

Snatch Balance - Make sure to dip at the start and use the legs to drive the bar, don't just drop down

Clean - Keep the bar close to the body

Push Jerk - Do not have the elbows fully up prior to jerk, bring them down angled to prepare for the dip and punch upwards

Snatch Deadlift - Do not perform like a conventional deadlift, start in the snatch position from the ground and emulate the first pull
