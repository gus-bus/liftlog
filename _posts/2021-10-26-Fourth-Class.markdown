1. Hang snatch 4x3; 75%
2. Snatch Balance 4x3; 90%
3. Deficit Snatch Deadlift 5x3

Accessories  
4 rounds

* Bent-over barbell row; overhand grip x 8
* Box jumps x 5
* GHD extensions; 10kg plate x 10

Hang Snatch - Need to keep the bar close, especially on the second pull, keep the bar touching the thighs

Got up to 57.5kg on hang snatch (1RM of 76kg?)

Right shoulder hurting on re-rack for snatch balance, couldn't complete, shoulder re-hab and stretching is a priority

Snatch Deadlift - Lift butt slightly higher to engage glutes prior to lifting
