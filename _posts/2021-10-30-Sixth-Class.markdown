Snatch - Need to be more explosive with the arms

Clean - Knees go back too quickly/suddenly, end up doing an RDL and then shooting forwards with knees and hips to "scoop" the bar up. Need to move knees back in tempo with standup, train this with clean deadlifts. Keep back angle the same and butt down. Bar needs to be in contact with thighs.

Back Squat - Lift butt slightly higher to engage glutes prior to lifting
